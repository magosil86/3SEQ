Description: Tools to identify recombinant sequences among up to 100.000
    sequences based on the 3SEQ program. This package implements an interface
    to high performance computing environments so that a very large number of
    sequences can be checked for recombinants in parallel. Potential
    recombinants can be further checked through phylogenetic incongruence
    plots. For this purpose, an interface to the ExaML program is implemented.
